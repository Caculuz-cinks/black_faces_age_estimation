# Black Faces Age Estimation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and dataset for an age estimation project using the Blackface dataset. The Blackface dataset was evaluated against several well-known datasets, including AgeDB, Appa-real, UTKFace, and FG-NET, using the ResNet50 architecture. The results demonstrated that the Blackface dataset achieved superior performance in estimating ages of black faces in unseen data.

## Results

The Blackface dataset outperformed other datasets in age estimation tasks, showing improved accuracy for estimating ages of black faces. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the evaluation script outputs.
